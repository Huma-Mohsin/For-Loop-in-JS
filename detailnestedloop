 Let's break down the code step by step:

Outer loop for rows:


for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
This line initializes a loop variable i to 1.
The loop runs as long as i is less than or equal to 10.
i is incremented by 1 in each iteration (i++).
-----------------------------------------------------
Inner loop for columns:

let row = "";  
for (let j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
Within each iteration of the outer loop, we initialize an empty string row to store the products of the current row.
This line initializes a loop variable j to 1.
The loop runs as long as j is less than or equal to 10.
j is incremented by 1 in each iteration (j++).

---------------------


Multiplication and concatenation:


row += (i * j) + "\t";  
Within the inner loop, we calculate the product of i and j (i * j), representing the value for the current cell in the multiplication table.
This product is then concatenated to the row string with a tab (\t) separator.
This process continues for all values of j within the current iteration of the outer loop (i).


---------------------
Printing the row:


console.log(row);  
After completing the inner loop for the current i, we print the row string using console.log().
This outputs a complete row of the multiplication table, with each product separated by tabs.


---------------------

Outer loop iteration:


}
After printing the row, the outer loop (for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++)) continues to the next value of i.
This process repeats until all rows of the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) are generated.
This nested loop structure ensures that we iterate over every combination of numbers from 1 to 10, generating a complete multiplication table as the output.
